# LA City Exploration 5 | Zoning
##Purpose
The City of Los Angeles is currently undertaking two large landuse and planning initiatives that involve multiple stakeholders, actors
and decision-makers in shaping the city. 

* recodeLA | Is an effort by the Los Angeles City Planning Department to comprehensively revise LA's outdated zoning. `First 
adopted in 1946, the current Code has grown from a simple, 84-page pamphlet to an unwieldy, 
600+ page book that inadequately realizes a 21st Century vision of a better Los Angeles for all residents.` [recodeLA website](http://recode.la/about)
